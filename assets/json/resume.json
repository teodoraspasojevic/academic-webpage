      "summary": "• I have worked on my thesis on topic of Consistency-aware Video Generation: Dynamic, Semantic, and Geometric Constraints for Improved Temporal Coherence. In the thesis, I enhance temporal consistency of video generation (VG) in an end-to-end multimodal manner. I propose a novel framework for fine-tuning pretrained VG models (specifically Stable Video Diffusion), while keeping the inference control-free. The framework enforces dynamic, semantic, and depth consistency using a set of losses. These losses compare outputs of off-the-shelf object detection (DN-DETR), feature extraction (DINO), and depth estimation models between ground-truth and generated videos. For this work, I have designed distributed training and evaluation pipelines deployed on GCP with Flyte, using support of accelerate library. \n • Additionally, I have contributed to a scientific publication accepted to the IEEE IV 2026 conference, based on this thesis, conducting all the experiments and contributing to the manuscript preparation."

This research contributed to a master’s thesis proposal. \n • I have experiments with models: Stable Video Diffusion (SVD), Vista WM, Cosmos WM and Ctrl-V (SVD with ControlNet). \n • Used infrastructure: Google’s cloud computing service (GCP) with Flyte and Weights&Biases support. I have developed a tutorial on GCP and workflow setup for GCP, now used by the team. \n • Participated and presented my work in team research sync meetings."
