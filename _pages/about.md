Hello! I am Teodora Spasojevic, a research-oriented recent Master’s graduate working on **generative diffusion-based models** and **world models**, with a primary focus on **autonomous driving applications**. My goal is to develop reliable generative systems that can serve as **scalable synthetic data engines** and as components of **foundation models**, particularly for **autonomous driving** and **medical (surgical) AI**.

I completed my Master’s degree at [Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen–Nuremberg](https://www.fau.de/) with majors in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Autonomous Driving**. Throughout my studies, I focused strongly on research and worked primarily under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Vasileios Belagiannis](https://www.lms.tf.fau.eu/person/vasileios-belagiannis/). Our collaboration included a research-oriented project thesis on **uncertainty estimation for generative models**, as well as my final Master’s thesis,  
_Consistency-Aware Video Generation: Dynamic, Semantic, and Geometric Constraints for Improved Temporal Coherence_, which was conducted mainly externally.

Along with my studies, I completed an internship and Master's thesis in **[Mercedes-Benz Autonomous Driving R&D] (https://group.mercedes-benz.com/innovation/product-innovation/autonomous-driving/)**, where I focused on diffusion-based video generation and world-model for autonomous systems. In my Master’s thesis conducted with the team, I proposed a fine-tuning framework for improving temporal consistency of **Stable Video Diffusion**, by enforcing dynamic, semantic, and depth constraints. This work led to our scientific publication, **accepted at [IEEE Intelligent Vehicles (IV) 2026] (https://ieee-iv.org/2026/)**.

In addition, I served as a Research Assistant in Information Theory project, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Laura Cottatellucci] (https://www.idc.tf.fau.eu/person/laura-cottatellucci/).
